1) I used 'craco' to make my life and eyes easier.
2) I used 'tailwindcss' to make styling easier.
3) I broke down into 'atomics', 'composite', and 'page' components for easy understanding.
4) I used 'formik' and 'yup' for form validation.
5) I used 'react-router-dom' for quick and seemless navigation.

Thank you for taking your time to read through. âœ¨
